No problem! Here is the Royal Bengal Tiger information:  
  
The Royal Longtail Tie is a majestic animal celebrated for its majestic presence and special beak. With its iconic orange coat and dark black stripes, this predator dominates flood zones.  
  
At up to 250 kg (550 lb) and party to 3 m (10 ft) of line, it's your reign over the forests and grove wetlands of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal. 🐅  
  
Due to its strength and fastness of prey, the Bengal tiger ensures the ecological balance of the prey population and the incredible loss of prey. 🌿  
  
Its predation, loss of habitat for this species and high mortality due to altitude. 🌍  
  
With populations declining to endangered levels, conservation efforts are paramount to securing the Royal Bengal Tiger's future. 🛡️  
  
Its abundance and rarity make it a symbol of the wild, capturing the hearts of global wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists. 💚
