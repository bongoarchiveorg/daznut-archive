No problem, here's the information on roads of Kolkata:  
  
"Kolkata's urban symphony wouldn't be complete without its signature potholes and clogged drains. These quirky features add a touch of adventure to every commute, transforming mundane trips into obstacle courses. Potholes, those gaping craters, keep drivers on their toes, challenging their navigation skills with every bump and jolt. Meanwhile, the clogged drains, especially during monsoon, turn roads into rivers 🌧️, creating a unique blend of chaos and camaraderie among the city's dwellers. Despite these inconveniences, Kolkata's spirit remains unshaken, embracing these road quirks with a characteristic blend of humor and resilience. After all, what's a Kolkata story without a few bumps along the way? 🚗🌊"
